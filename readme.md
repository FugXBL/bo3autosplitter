# Black Ops 3 Auto-Splitter Info

The auto-splitter is currently setup using A LOT of memory codes. An update could mess this whole thing up. For it's current state, it works perfectly as intended for the US version on steam (other than nightmares). If you run through any bugs, please report it to me on discord (*Ndt#8844*) and I will try my best to find a new memory code. Currently, the load remover is setup to function on both Nightmares AND Campaign. However, the auto-splitter is only intended on Campaign so far, but there might be a chance that it works on Nightmares. I'd honestly disable the auto-splitter on Nightmares by toggling off the "split", "start", and "reset" settings but I'd keep the ASL script activated so the load remover works (makes verifying runs easier).


# Black Ops 3 Auto-Splitter Settings

**Start**: This will determine if the livesplit timer will automatically start when you start your run

**Split**: This will determine if the auto-splitter is on or off

**Reset**: This will determine if the timer will be reset whenever you reset your campaign stats (only useful for NG so you don't have to manually reset the timer)

**Start Timer in Safehouse**: Automatically starts the timer when the safehouse is booted up. This is only intended for the NG category when performing the UI Stack glitch. If you are running any other category, this setting can be turned off.

**Load Remover**: Pauses the "Game Time" timer whenever the game is loading. In order for this to work, you must have a "Game Time" timer on your layout. It is recommended that you have both "Game Time" and "Real Time" timers to make verification easier.

**Auto-Split By Map**: When toggled on, the auto-splitter will split when the map is fully loaded out instead of splitting similar to the current timing method. Only use this when you are having issues without this option on.

**Auto-Split Missions**: This will determine if the auto-splitter will function on the desired mission(s)

**Nightmares Fast-Loads**: Disables the load remover removing fast-loads on Nightmares. Nightmares is buggy and the memory codes don't work as well on there so the fast-load memory code can break at times and cause the LRT to be way off. Disabling the setting prevents that but it will take longer to retime.
